                                               PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

PROJECT TITLE : Credit Power-Up
During the initial week of our project implementation, we have made significant progress. We started by initiating the data collection process and concurrently integrated various datasets, which brought us closer to the central data repository. We also identified the stages of data analysis specifically related to credit factors. However, we encountered some challenges, including poor data quality, which required us to perform data cleaning. Additionally, we faced issues related to permission access, which led to a slowdown in our data acquisition process. Our primary focus moving forward will be to continue integrating data and refining it through the data cleaning process to obtain a more pristine version from our data sources.

For our database formatting, we utilized SQL and even created an SQL diagram to represent it.
