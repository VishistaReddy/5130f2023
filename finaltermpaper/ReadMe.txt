TERM PAPER TITLE : Web vulnerability mitigation Using ModSecurity and Reverse Proxy

ABSTRACT : The usage of web applications has experienced significant growth, with various individuals, groups, organizations, and even governments relying on web applications for information exchange and support of business activities. However, this surge in adoption has brought about an equivalent increase in security threats and attacks targeting web applications. As a response to these escalating risks, there is a growing need for more robust web application security measures. One effective security concept in this realm is the Web Application Firewall (WAF), which serves to protect web applications by filtering network traffic, blocking potentially malicious HTTP requests, and maintaining comprehensive logs of activities. This paper aims to demonstrate and propose the integration of a WAF into a web-based application using the ModSecurity and Reverse Proxy method.
